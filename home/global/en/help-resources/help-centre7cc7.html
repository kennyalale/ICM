                                                <div class="panel-content">This is one of the most frequently asked questions. The difficult part in understanding ECN and STP meanings is that those have been interpreted differently by many people. There are three main business models used by Forex brokers which differ by the way the transactions are handled and orders are executed: ECN, STP and Market Makers.<br><br>ECN: ECN stands for 'Electronic Communication Network' which is simply a technical term that is used to describe how banks and liquidity providers connect to each other to form a bid and offer price. In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client, a liquidity provider or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution that may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider processes all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider, this price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed, hence it is known as STP.<br><br>IC Markets is the issuer of the products it provides. We consider ourselves to be a forex provider offering the ECN pricing model as we source our pricing from external unrelated liquidity providers , these prices are passed onto you with no dealing desk intervention. In order to provide you with better price certainty and to ensure fast execution speed we do not offset each and every position with our liquidity providers. We do this in order to provide you with a better overall trading experience.<br>&nbsp;</div>

In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client or liquidity provider, or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution, which may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider process all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider. This price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed; hence, it is known as STP.<br><br>IC Markets is the issuer of the products it provides. We consider ourselves to be a Forex provider offering the ECN pricing model as we source our pricing from external unrelated liquidity providers. These prices are passed on to you with no dealing desk intervention. In order to provide you with better price certainty and to ensure fast execution speed, we do not hedge each and every position with our liquidity providers. We do this in order to provide you with a better overall trading experience.</div>

The reason for this is that spot Forex contracts have a two-day settlement period. For example, a spot Forex contract that occurred on Monday settles on Wednesday, a trade that occurred on Tuesday settles on Thursday, a trade that occurred on Wednesday settles on Friday, but a trade that occurred on Thursday settles on the following Monday. In this example, the trade that occurred on Thursday rolled through the weekend because the banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Triple rollover interest is applied to positions held open at 5pm New York time on Wednesday as this time marks the beginning of the new 24-hour trading day (Thursday). <br><br>You should note that swap rates can be negative or positive, depending on the currency pair traded and the prevailing interest rates at that time.</div>

The ex-dividend date is the day a stock starts trading without its dividend payment. In the case of an index, an adjustment will be made that is equal to the number of points by which the index price must be adjusted downwards to take account of those shares in the index which go ex-dividend at the close of the cash market. The ex-dividend figure estimated by Bloomberg, rounded to the tick size we use for that index, is used to determine what adjustment to apply. In the case of long positions, the dividend adjustment is in the form a trading account credit. In the case of short positions, the dividend adjustment is in the form of a trading account debit.</div>

You must refer to the bid prices to check whether the requested take profit price level on a buy trade has been reached or not. However, in the case of a sell trade, you must refer to the ask prices. It is also important to note that a standard account has one pip mark-up on the raw spreads. This spread mark-up does not appear in bid prices recorded on the chart by default.<br></div>

Using leverage means that you are able to deposit a smaller amount of money to achieve the same buying power as you would have if you bought and sold the currencies outright.<br><br>In this example, Mary deposits $5,000 into her Forex trading account and nominates the leverage on her account to be 1:100. As a result of leverage, Mary’s buying power on her $5,000 deposit becomes $500,000. Mary decides to buy 0.1 lots of the AUD/USD par at a price of 0.99802. Three days later, the price of the AUD/USD is 1.04069 and Mary decides to close her position. Mary’s profit is calculated as (1.04069 – 0.99802) 426 pips. As Mary opened a position of 0.1 lots, she made a profit of $426, or $1 per pip.<br><br>Of course, should the AUD/USD have moved against Mary below the opening price of her trade to a level of 0.97802, Mary would have incurred a loss on the trade of (0.99802 – 0.95542) 426 pips. As Mary’s position size was 0.1 lots, she would have incurred a loss of $426 or $1 per pip.<br><br>It is important to be aware that when trading Forex you can also incur losses which can be greater than your initial deposit.</div>

The most common form of risk management is the use of stop loss and limit orders.

Identify whether the file is archived or in its normal format. To perform this check, right-click on the file and select ‘Properties’. At the top, it will say if it is a MetaQuotes Language 4 file. If it is not, it is most likely an archive. If the file is archived or zipped, make sure to unzip the file.<br><br>Now, open your MT4 platform. At the menu bar, click ‘File’ and navigate to ‘Open Data Folder’. Double click the ‘MQL4’ folder and open the ‘Experts’ folder. Now go back to where you have downloaded your EA and drag it into the open ‘Experts’ folder.<br><br>Once done, close all windows. Restart MetaTrader 4 platform and the EA should appear in your ‘Navigator’ panel.</div>

This means that a smaller move in your favour will result in a larger profit and a smaller move against you will result in a large loss. If the price of the CFD you are trading gaps or moves against you quickly, it is possible that you could lose more than your account balance.<br><br>Although we will attempt to close your position when the margin level falls to 50% of the required margin (stop out level), we cannot guarantee that your account will not enter into a negative balance. You will be in margin call when the margin level drops to 100% of the required margin; at this point, you will see the position change colour in your trading platform. This is an indication to take appropriate measures by either reducing the exposure or adding additional funds to the trading account. If the margin level drops a further 50%, the platform will automatically start closing out positions.</div>

MT4 was built by Metaquotes, has been around for the longest and remains the most popular amongst traders while cTrader is relatively new in comparison and has several features that do not exist on other platforms. MT5 is a newer version of MT4 but is yet to become popular. Each of the trading platforms we offer is different and we recommend that you try demos of all of them to see which one best suits your trading style. The user interface, advanced take profit and stop loss systems, detachable charts, varying chart time frames, live sentiment and depth of market displayed by default are among the key differences. There is also a vast range of custom indicators and EA readily available for MT4.<br></div>

This logic will replace cTrader’s Fair Stop Out logic because it provides significant benefits for users by using a much more advanced algorithm.<br><br>If margin level falls below Smart Stop Out level, then positions will start being partially closed until margin level reaches above the Smart Stop Out. The logic of Smart Stop Out will only close what is absolutely necessary from the largest position in order to safely restore margin level and protect the position itself, the position entry point and the trading account for as long as possible.<br><br>For more information, see <a href="https://www.icmarkets.com/global/forex-trading-platform-ctrader/smart-stop-out">cTrader Smart Stop Out</a> page.</div>

This process is automated and is not a guarantee that your account will not enter into a negative equity situation. We recommend that you always maintain a balance in your account over and above your required margin. If the stop level is reached, a market order is triggered to close your open positions at the next available price in the market.<br><br>Events such as markets gapping over the weekend or on major holidays, where liquidity is thin, can increase the chance of your positions being stopped out and a negative equity situation occurring. We advise that you use stop loss orders to limit your risk and monitor the margin level in your account regularly. You will be responsible for any negative balance in your trading account.</div>

Whether you are trading Stocks, Futures, Commodities or Forex, you will be subject to slippage. When you place a market order, you are requesting your order is filled at the current market prices; however, if the market has moved between the time you place your order and the time it has been filled, your order may be filled at a different price. Slippage can increase when markets become volatile, such as over new releases. You should keep this in mind when trading outside of normal market conditions.<br><br>Stop loss orders, when triggered, enter the market as market orders; therefore, there is no guarantee that your order will be filled at the price you placed your stop loss.</div>

On the MT4/MT5 platform, if the account is perfectly hedged and does not require any margin, the positions will remain open. However, in the case of the cTrader platform, the margin is required for the direction carrying the higher volume and margin requirements, irrespective of whether the overall position of the account is perfectly hedged.<br><br>The hedge margin level may vary for different products.

Foreign exchange is always traded in pairs, for example EUR/USD or AUD/USD."},{"o":0,"id":"i_28","ip":"#i_28","q":"How is a profit or loss incurred when trading Forex?","a":"Making money trading Forex involves buying lower and selling higher or selling higher and buying back lower. Using leverage means that you are able to deposit a smaller amount of money to achieve the same buying power as you would have if you bought and sold the currencies outright.<br><br>In this example, Mary deposits $5,000 into her Forex trading account and nominates the leverage on her account to be 1:100. As a result of leverage, Mary’s buying power on her $5,000 deposit becomes $500,000. Mary decides to buy 0.1 lots of the AUD/USD par at a price of 0.99802. Three days later, the price of the AUD/USD is 1.04069 and Mary decides to close her position. Mary’s profit is calculated as (1.04069 – 0.99802) 426 pips. As Mary opened a position of 0.1 lots, she made a profit of $426, or $1 per pip.<br><br>Of course, should the AUD/USD have moved against Mary below the opening price of her trade to a level of 0.97802, Mary would have incurred a loss on the trade of (0.99802 – 0.95542) 426 pips. As Mary’s position size was 0.1 lots, she would have incurred a loss of $426 or $1 per pip.<br><br>It is important to be aware that when trading Forex you can also incur losses which can be greater than your initial deposit."},{"o":0,"id":"i_29","ip":"#i_29","q":"Is the Forex market a fair market?","a":"Forex is said to be one of the fairest and most transparent markets on earth.

The Forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, it opens in New Zealand and closes in New York."},{"o":0,"id":"i_31","ip":"#i_31","q":"Who are the main participants in the Forex market?","a":"The main participants in the Forex market are central banks, commercial banks and investment banks, however, in recent years - since the advent of the internet - accessibility to the Forex market has increased, which has resulted in an increase in the number of non-bank participants.

The most notable influences include interest rates, inflation and political stability. Sometimes, governments will buy or sell a currency in an effort to influence its value with a view to having a broader effect on the country’s economy. This is known as ‘central bank intervention’ and can have a significant impact on the value of a currency. Given the size and diversity of participants, no one single factor can influence the Forex market for any significant length of time."},{"o":0,"id":"i_35","ip":"#i_35","q":"How do I manage risk when trading Forex?","a":"Forex traders can use a variety of risk management strategies. The most common form of risk management is the use of stop loss and limit orders. Stop loss orders can be set within the MetaTrader 4 platform and are often used to force the closure of a position at a predetermined price in order to limit any potential loss.

Nowadays, technical trading is becoming increasingly popular and traders are using a variety of technical indicators, such as trend lines, support and resistance levels, and numerous other methods, to identify short-to-medium term trading opportunities. Some traders choose to use fundamental analysis, which revolves around interpreting economic information including news, government reports and sometimes even rumour.

This includes events such as central bank intervention, interest rate changes, political change or even war."},{"o":0,"id":"i_37","ip":"#i_37","q":"Is trading the Forex market expensive?","a":"No, trading Forex has never been cheaper or more accessible.

Margin is calculated based on the current price of the base currency against USD, the size (volume) of the position and the leverage applied to your trading account. If you do not have sufficient free equity available, you will be unable to open a position on the trading platform. The free margin amount shown in the trading platform is the amount you have available to use should you wish to open additional positions.<br><br>Margin is calculated using the following formula:<br><br>Margin required = (current market price x volume) / Account leverage<br><br>In practice, this would be calculated as follows:<br>If you open a position of 0.1 (10000) in EUR/USD at the current market price of 1.35645 and your account has a leverage of 1:400, you would calculate the margin required as follows:<br>(1.35645 x 10000) / 400 = $33.91<br><br>In this example, the margin on this position would be $33.91; therefore, in order to open a position of this size you would require at least $33.91 in free margin in your trading account."},{"o":0,"id":"i_51","ip":"#i_51","q":"Can I set pending orders in MetaTrader 4?","a":"MetaTrader 4 allows pending orders to be set.

Equity is calculated as (Balance + Open Profit/Loss)."},{"o":0,"id":"i_55","ip":"#i_55","q":"What is IC Markets’ margin stop out level?","a":"IC Markets’ margin stop out level is 50%. This means that if your free margin falls below 50%, then your positions will be automatically closed. MetaTrader 4 will automatically close them in order of the largest losing position to the smallest.<br><br>The margin stop out level is calculated using the following formula.<br>Margin level = equity / used margin x 100%<br>= margin level %<br><br>Worked example<br>The margin on a $10,000 USD (equity) trading account with 1 standard lot open position on USD/JPY and 100 times leverage would be calculated as follows:<br>= 10,000 / 1,000 x 100%<br>= 1000% margin level<br>If the position moves against you and your equity fell to $5,000, the calculation would be:<br><br>= 5,000 / 1,000 x 100%<br>= 500% margin level<br><br>If the position moved against you even further and the equity fell to $499, the position would be stopped out as the margin level would have fallen below 100%.<br>= 499 / 1,000 x 100%<br>= 49.9% margin level"},{"o":0,"id":"i_56","ip":"#i_56","q":"What is cTrader Smart Stop Out?","a":"The Smart Stop Out logic in cTrader has been designed to provide maximum protection to traders’ accounts. This logic will replace cTrader’s Fair Stop Out logic because it provides significant benefits for users by using a much more advanced algorithm.<br><br>If margin level falls below Smart Stop Out level, then positions will start being partially closed until margin level reaches above the Smart Stop Out. The logic of Smart Stop Out will only close what is absolutely necessary from the largest position in order to safely restore margin level and protect the position itself, the position entry point and the trading account for as long as possible.<br><br>For more information, see <a href=\"/global/forex-trading-platform-ctrader/smart-stop-out\">cTrader Smart Stop Out</a> page."},{"o":0,"id":"i_57","ip":"#i_57","q":"What does the Deal Confirmation window mean?","a":"The Deal Confirmation window displays a summary of the order that you have placed, including the order number, quantity (volume) and price the order was filled at.

In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client or liquidity provider, or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution, which may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider process all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider. This price is simply passed on by the broker.

In this example, the trade that occurred on Thursday rolled through the weekend because the banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Triple rollover interest is applied to positions held open at 5pm New York time on Wednesday as this time marks the beginning of the new 24-hour trading day (Thursday). <br><br>You should note that swap rates can be negative or positive, depending on the currency pair traded and the prevailing interest rates at that time."},{"o":0,"id":"i_149","ip":"#i_149","q":"How many Stocks CFDs do you offer?","a":"IC Markets offers over 1600 Stocks CFDs.

On the MT4/MT5 platform, if the account is perfectly hedged and does not require any margin, the positions will remain open.
